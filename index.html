                <p>Like instant coffee where you just add water and your coffee is ready to
                    drink, IIFE are functions that run immediately from the moment that you
                    created them, there is no need to call them.
                </p>
                <p>Like the instant coffee, you get one cup, after you drink it, that's it. Same with
                    IIFE, as it's an anonymous function, you can't call it again after. </p>

            <div class="Grid__text__definition">
                <p>A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing)
                    function's variables — a scope chain <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-closures-simplified-d0d23fa06ba4">(source)</a></p>
                <p>For every closure we have three scopes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Local Scope (Own scope)</li>
                    <li>Outer Functions Scope</li>

                <p>Imagine the squirrel's house being the inner function; from there, the squirrel has access to the
                    entire tree (which is like the outer function) so she can take the acorn (variable) if she wants to.
                    She also have access to the rest of the forest(global scope).

                <p>When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors <a href="https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing">(source)</a></p>

                <p>Imagine a water drop touching the surface of the lake. This event (the drop touching the surface) is propagating, causeing ripples to appear. Same way, with bubbling, an event is handled first by the inner element (child) and then propagated to the outer elements (parents).</p>

                <p>Conceptually, for example, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your code, but this is not in fact what happens. Instead, the variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting">(source)</a></p>
